# Week 1: Familiarize with Tech Stack

## 1) Setup Your Machine

- [ ] **Install PHP:**  
    Download the latest version as a zipped folder from [here](https://windows.php.net/download/) and extract it. Place the folder in `Program Files`. Verify the installation by running the following command:

    Download and run `node.exe` from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer). Verify the installation by running the following command:

    node -v
    ```

- [ ] **Install Composer:**  
    Download and run `Composer-Setup.exe` from [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#using-the-installer). Make sure PHP is already installed before this step. Verify the installation by running the following command:
    ```
    composer -v
    ```

- [ ] **Install VS Code:**  
    Download the zipped version from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and extract it. Run `code.exe`.

- [ ] **Install Laragon:**  
    Download from [here](https://laragon.org/download/) and run the `.exe` file to install. **Important:** Every time you need to run a Laravel project, click the "Start All" button.
